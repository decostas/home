			<h1>My Super Power!</h1>
			<p><img src="09.jpg" width="485" height="715" alt="Legendary Super Saiyan"></p>
			<h2>What is it?</h2>
			<p>The Super Saiyans are a blood thirsty warrior race that improves dramatically over fight to the brink of death. It gets to the point where a saiyans ability would match the wrath of a supernova or 100 suns exploding simultaneously. Did I mention they could fly and shoot out lasers out of my hands that could decimate an entire galaxy?</p>
			<h2>How I got it?</h2>
			<p>I got my superpower when my friend Kabir Jewani pushed me to my limit his constant jokes about me has pushed me too far and this time its too late to come back. I burst into a ball of flames and emerge as a green tyrant of a legendary warrior fighting race called the Super Saiyans.</p>
			<h2>What I do with it?</h2>
			<p>I basically do whatever comes to mind, but i usually mess with my friend Kabir Jewani for example I would blow up his house for a prank or leave him in an isolated island, with food of course I'm not a monster.</p>
